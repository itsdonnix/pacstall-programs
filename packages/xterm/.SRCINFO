	pkgdesc = X terminal emulator xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System. It provides DEC VT102 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the window system directly. This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals. This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the luit package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings. A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm. The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package. Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the xfonts-cyrillic package as well.
